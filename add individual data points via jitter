// this is currently the code for working with multiple categorical data with several boxplots in one graph. Currently I'm having issues translating this into a graph 
with one boxplot. The file of just x axis and plotted line is boxplot graphed horizontally after getting rid of box so we would want to add
individual points to that ideally using jitter but since this jitter is made to work with different data input(a github file as opposed to a 1d array) I am unsure 
of how to add it to a plot with 1d array data input
